// ✅ Two Pointer Practice (Day Update)

// Today I continued practicing the Two Pointer Technique and solved more problems based on this approach.

// Two Pointer is one of the most important DSA patterns, especially for solving array and string problems efficiently.
// It helps in reducing the time complexity from brute force O(n²) to optimized O(n) solutions.

// 📌 What I Practiced Today

// ✔ Solved more Two Pointer based questions
// ✔ Improved understanding of pointer movement logic
// ✔ Practiced both patterns:

// Left-Right pointer approach

// Slow-Fast pointer approach

// 🧠 Key Concepts Revised

// Using two pointers to shrink the search space

// Handling sorted arrays efficiently

// Avoiding extra space by using in-place operations

// Optimizing solutions from nested loops to linear traversal

// 🚀 Outcome of Today's Practice

// After solving multiple problems, I gained better clarity on:

// When to move left++

// When to move right--

// How to maintain conditions properly in loops

// How to solve problems using constant space

// ⏱ Time & Space Complexity

// Most Two Pointer problems solved today had:

// Time Complexity: O(n)

// Space Complexity: O(1)
