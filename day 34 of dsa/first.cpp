// Today I focused on revising the concepts that I studied earlier.
// Instead of learning a new topic, I revised previous DSA topics to strengthen fundamentals and improve problem-solving speed.

// ✅ What I Revised Today

// Two Pointer technique basics

// String fundamentals and common operations

// Important conditions and edge cases

// Time complexity and space complexity concepts

// Previously solved questions logic revision

// 🧠 Key Learnings from Revision

// ✔ Revision helped me recall logic faster
// ✔ Improved understanding of pointer movement
// ✔ Better clarity in string manipulation problems
// ✔ Strengthened concepts for medium/hard level questions

// ⏱ Complexity Focus

// Two Pointer based problems → O(n)

// String traversal problems → O(n)

// Space optimized approaches → O(1) where possible
