# 📘 Day 01 – Introduction to Programming (Complete Detailed Notes)

Today marks the beginning of my DSA journey. I started by understanding the basic concepts on which all programming and problem-solving is built. Here is everything I learned in detail:

## 1️⃣ What Is Programming?

Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer so that it can perform tasks.
Computers do not understand human language—they only understand logic and machine-level instructions.
So, we write code that tells the computer what to do, how to do it, and when to do it.

### Why it matters:
- It helps automate tasks  
- It solves real-life problems  
- It builds applications, websites, games, systems, AI etc.  
- It develops logical and analytical thinking

## 2️⃣ How Programming Started & Why It’s Needed

### How it started
Programming began when people built machines to perform tasks automatically.  
Early programs were written using punch cards.  
Later, languages like Assembly, C, Java, Python were invented.

### Why it’s needed today
Programming powers:
- Websites
- Apps
- Games
- Banking
- AI & ML
- Automation
- Robots
- Software systems

## 3️⃣ Flowchart – Representing Logical Steps Visually

A flowchart visually represents steps using symbols.

### Benefits:
- Easy to understand  
- Helps plan logic before coding  
- Shows step-by-step flow  

### Common symbols:
- Oval → Start / End  
- Rectangle → Process  
- Diamond → Decision  
- Arrows → Flow

## 4️⃣ Pseudocode – Writing Logic in Simple Words

Pseudocode explains logic using normal English, not real code.

Example:
```
Start
Input number
If number > 0
  Print "Positive"
Else
  Print "Not Positive"
End
```

## 🌟 Summary
Learned:
- What programming is  
- Why programming exists  
- Flowchart basics  
- Pseudocode writing  

A strong foundation for the journey ahead!
