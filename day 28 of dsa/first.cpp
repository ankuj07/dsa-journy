// ✅ Day 28 – Two Pointer Practice (Basic + Easy + Medium)

// Today, I focused on the Two Pointer Technique and solved multiple problems from basic, easy, and medium levels to strengthen my problem-solving skills.

// 📌 What I Practiced Today

// The Two Pointer technique is mainly used to optimize problems related to:

// Arrays (especially sorted arrays)

// Strings

// Pair / Triplet searching problems

// Subarray and window-based logic

// 🔥 Topics Covered

// Two Pointer Basics (Left & Right pointer approach)

// Finding pairs in sorted arrays

// String-based two pointer problems

// Optimization of brute force solutions

// Improving time complexity from O(n²) to O(n)

// 🧠 Problems Solved (Easy + Medium)
// ✅ Easy Level

// Reverse Array / Reverse String

// Check Palindrome

// Move Zeroes

// Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

// Two Sum (Sorted Array)

// ✅ Medium Level

// Container With Most Water

// Sort Colors (Dutch National Flag Algorithm)

// Pair with Given Difference

// Basic 3Sum approach understanding

// Two Pointer based subarray logic problems

// 📌 Key Learnings

// Two Pointer is extremely useful when the array is sorted.

// The main idea is to move pointers based on the condition:

// Increase left pointer when we need a bigger value

// Decrease right pointer when we need a smaller value

// Helps in reducing unnecessary loops and improves efficiency.

// ⏱ Complexity Improvement

// Many problems were optimized from:

// ❌ O(n²) (Brute Force)
// to
// ✅ O(n) (Two Pointer)
