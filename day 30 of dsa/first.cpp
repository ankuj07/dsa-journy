// 🔁 Revision Update (DSA)

// Today I focused mainly on revising the concepts that I studied earlier.
// Instead of solving new topics, I revised previous DSA learning to strengthen my understanding and improve problem-solving speed.

// ✅ What I Revised Today

// Binary Search fundamentals

// Time Complexity and Space Complexity concepts

// Two Pointer technique basics

// Pointer movement logic (left-right / slow-fast)

// Common patterns used in interview problems

// 🧠 Key Learnings from Revision

// ✔ Revision helps in remembering logic quickly
// ✔ Improved clarity in conditions and edge cases
// ✔ Better understanding of optimized approaches
// ✔ Strengthened fundamentals for upcoming problems

// ⏱ Complexity Focus

// During revision, I revised the most important complexity concepts:

// Binary Search → O(log n)

// Two Pointer → O(n)

// Space Optimization → O(1) in most cases

// 🎯 Conclusion

// This revision session helped me refresh important DSA patterns and build confidence.
// Next, I will continue solving more medium-level problems with better speed and accuracy.
